## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character tries to use a pre-apocalypse coupon or loyalty card in the new absurd economy.
- Create a 'Department of Forgotten Protocols' field manual entry for a mundane social rule (e.g., 'Queueing for the Bus').
- Draft a 'Customer Satisfaction Survey' found by a character, asking for feedback on the apocalypse event itself.
- Write a monologue from the perspective of a non-human entity (like the crows in the legislative chamber) observing the new human behaviors.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Receipt Generator' that creates absurd store credit slips for intangible concepts (e.g., 'One Slightly Used Hope', '15 Minutes of Unwarranted Confidence').
- Design a database schema for the 'Dead Letter Office' cataloging undeliverable mail by emotional content and failure reason.
