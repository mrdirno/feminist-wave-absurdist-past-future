  "cover_prompt": "A woman in practical, slightly worn clothing stands resolute in a cavernous, abandoned government archive, meticulously placing a faded, personal photograph into a towering, labyrinthine filing cabinet that stretches into dusty infinity, under the sickly glow of flickering fluorescent lights. The scene is one of surreal order amidst decay, with endless aisles of identical cabinets, scattered papers forming small dunes on the linoleum floor, and a single forgotten potted plant thriving absurdly on a desk. In the atmospheric style of Remedios Varo and Edward Hopper, blending magical realism with stark, lonely realism and meticulous detail. Book cover framing, centered composition with a slightly low, dramatic angle looking up at the towering cabinets to emphasize scale and oppression, a single shaft of weak daylight slicing through high, grimy windows. Chiaroscuro lighting with pools of harsh fluorescent light and deep shadows, a color palette of institutional greens, muted beiges, archival grey, and the warm, anomalous sepia of the photograph. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
